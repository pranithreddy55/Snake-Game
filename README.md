# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat food pellets placed randomly on the screen, which makes the snake grow longer. The game continues until the snake either collides with the boundaries of the screen or with itself.
# Features
The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food.
The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or with itself.
The speed of the game can be adjusted by changing the SPEED constant in the code.
The game has a simple UI that displays the score and updates in real-time as the game progresses.
# How to Play
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
Eat the food pellets (red squares) to grow longer and increase your score.
Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen or with the snake's own body.
The game ends when the snake collides with a boundary or with itself.
Try to achieve the highest score possible!
